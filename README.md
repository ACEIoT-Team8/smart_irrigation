INTRODUCTION
 
New technologies are helping in building automated systems resulting in a huge reduction of human work done. Watering is a crucial factor in farming and sometimes, problems occur if not well regulated due to overwatering or underwatering. This is the reason to be of our proposed system “Smart irrigation” to avoid all those incidents and ensure smart farming through smart irrigation.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT 

The main objective of this project was to Design and implement an IoT based smart irrigation system using NodeMCU.

Specific Objectives:
•	The proposed project aims to ease the process of irrigation by supplying water when farm is dry without human presence and
•	 avoiding water wastage in irrigation process.
It also allows easy monitoring and visualization as the data from the sensors are sent to the client

COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

Hardware:

NodeMCU ESP8266
 NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. it includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Expressive Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module.

 Soil Moisture Sensor Module
A simple soil moisture sensor for gardeners. Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighting of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must be calibrated and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, or electric conductivity. Reflected microwave radiation is affected by the soil moisture and is used for remote sensing in hydrology and agriculture. Portable probe instruments can be used by farmers or gardeners.
