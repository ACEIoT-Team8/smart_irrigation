INTRODUCTION
 
New technologies are helping in building automated systems resulting in a huge reduction of human work done. Watering is a crucial factor in farming and sometimes, problems occur if not well regulated due to overwatering or underwatering. This is the reason to be of our proposed system “Smart irrigation” to avoid all those incidents and ensure smart farming through smart irrigation.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT 

The main objective of this project was to Design and implement an IoT based smart irrigation system using NodeMCU.

Specific Objectives:
•	The proposed project aims to ease the process of irrigation by supplying water when farm is dry without human presence and
•	 avoiding water wastage in irrigation process.
It also allows easy monitoring and visualization as the data from the sensors are sent to the client
